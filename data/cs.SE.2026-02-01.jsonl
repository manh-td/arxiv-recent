{"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00972v1", "title": "Cast: Automated Resilience Testing for Production Cloud Service Systems", "summary": "The distributed nature of microservice architecture introduces significant resilience challenges. Traditional testing methods, limited by extensive manual effort and oversimplified test environments, fail to capture production system complexity. To address these limitations, we present Cast, an automated, end-to-end framework for microservice resilience testing in production. It achieves high test fidelity by replaying production traffic against a comprehensive library of application-level faults to exercise internal error-handling logic. To manage the combinatorial test space, Cast employs a complexity-driven strategy to systematically prune redundant tests and prioritize high-value tests targeting the most critical service execution paths. Cast automates the testing lifecycle through a three-phase pipeline (i.e., startup, fault injection, and recovery) and uses a multi-faceted oracle to automatically verify system resilience against nuanced criteria. Deployed in Huawei Cloud for over eight months, Cast has been adopted by many service teams to proactively address resilience vulnerabilities. Our analysis on four large-scale applications with millions of traces reveals 137 potential vulnerabilities, with 89 confirmed by developers. To further quantify its performance, Cast is evaluated on a benchmark set of 48 reproduced bugs, achieving a high coverage of 90%. The results show that Cast is a practical and effective solution for systematically improving the reliability of industrial microservice systems.", "published": "2026-02-01T02:29:25Z", "updated": "2026-02-01T02:29:25Z", "authors": ["Zhuangbin Chen", "Zhiling Deng", "Kaiming Zhang", "Yang Liu", "Cheng Cui", "Jinfeng Zhong", "Zibin Zheng"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.00972v1"}
