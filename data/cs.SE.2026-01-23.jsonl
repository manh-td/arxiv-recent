To this end, it is essential to understand how developers approach licensing compliance tasks, the challenges they encounter, and the tools they use.

Central to this shift is prompt engineering, the practice of crafting textual prompts to guide GenAI tools in generating useful content. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, prior research has focused primarily on cataloging of prompting techniques, with limited attention to how software practitioners employ GenAI within real-world development workflows. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic investigation of practitioners' integration of GenAI tools into software development, drawing on a rigorous survey that examines prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across core software development tasks.\n  We surveyed 72 software practitioners who actively use GenAI to characterize AI usage patterns throughout the development process. By combining qualitative and quantitative analyses of the survey responses, we identified 13 key findings that describe how prompting is performed in practice. Our study shows that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with the use of GenAI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review. Practitioners also tend to favor iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging remain major challenges.

This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers.

A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics.

In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software.

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines.

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider.

Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation.

This research analyzes the utility of software complexity metrics as diagnostic tools for identifying vulnerable Solidity smart contracts. We evaluate the hypothesis that complexity measures serve as vital, complementary signals for security assessment. Through an empirical examination of 21 distinct metrics, we analyzed their inter-dependencies, statistical association with vulnerabilities, and discriminative capabilities. Our findings indicate a significant degree of redundancy among certain metrics and a relatively low correlation between any single metric and the presence of vulnerabilities. However, the data demonstrates that these metrics possess strong power to distinguish between secure and vulnerable code when analyzed collectively.

In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions.

To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case.

Commit Message Generation (CMG) aims to automatically generate descriptive commit messages from code diffs to reduce developers' effort and improve message quality. Although recent advances in LLMs have shown promise in automating CMG, their performance remains limited. This paper aims to enhance CMG performance by retrieving similar diff-message pairs to guide LLMs to generate commit messages that are more precise and informative. We proposed CoRaCMG, a Contextual Retrieval-augmented framework for Commit Message Generation, structured in three phases: (1) Retrieve: retrieving the similar diff-message pairs; (2) Augment: combining them with the query diff into a structured prompt; and (3) Generate: generating commit messages corresponding to the query diff via LLMs. CoRaCMG enables LLMs to learn project-specific terminologies and writing styles from the retrieved diff-message pairs. We evaluated CoRaCMG across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen) and compared its performance against SOTA baselines. Experimental results show that CoRaCMG significantly boosts LLM performance across four metrics (BLEU, Rouge-L, METEOR, and CIDEr). Specifically, DeepSeek-R1 achieves relative improvements of 76% in BLEU and 71% in CIDEr when augmented with a single retrieved example pair. After incorporating the single example pair, GPT-4o achieves the highest improvement rate, with BLEU increasing by 89%.

The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a gcc compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.", "published": "2025-12-17T13:43:32Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T07:28:18Z", "authors": ["Ben Swierzy", "Marc Ohm", "Michael Meier"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15447v2"}

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.", "published": "2026-01-23T07:14:34Z", "updated": "2026-01-23T07:14:34Z", "authors": ["Junjie Shi", "Weisong Sun", "Zhenpeng Chen", "Zhujun Wu", "Xiaohong Chen", "Zhi Jin", "Yang Liu"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16507v1"}

Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%.

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment.

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings.

In this paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer, Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration. Embedbench consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1. Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
