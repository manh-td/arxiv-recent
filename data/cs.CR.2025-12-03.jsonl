Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.", "published": "2025-12-03T18:32:19Z", "updated": "2025-12-03T18:32:19Z", "authors": ["Yizhou Zhao", "Zhiwei Steven Wu", "Adam Block"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04044v1"}

This extra step, called Step~$9^\\dagger$, replaces the domain extension stage in Steps~8--9. The published Step~9 calls an amplitude periodicity lemma, yet its hypotheses break in the presence of affine offsets $\\boldsymbol{v}^*$. Our analysis finds a basic conflict between two design constraints. The lattice problem asks for high spectral resolution, so the method prefers wide time windows. The quadratic phase error of the state prefers narrow time windows. Assumption~A5 packages the spectral concentration and near-uniformity properties that we require from the front end. Under~A5, a direct $\\mathbb{Z}_M^n$ Fourier transform of the chirp-corrected coordinate state produces samples $\\boldsymbol{u}$ that satisfy $\\langle \\boldsymbol{b}, \\boldsymbol{u} \\rangle \\equiv 0 \\pmod{Q}$ with probability $1-\\mathrm{negl}(n)$ and are nearly uniform on the dual hyperplane $\\{\\boldsymbol{u} : \\langle \\boldsymbol{b}, \\boldsymbol{u} \\rangle \\equiv 0 \\pmod{Q}\\}$. The new procedure does not require internal access to control wires. It uses the normalization $b_1=-1$ to apply a center-referenced phase correction directly on the first coordinate register. The scaling parameter $D$ ensures that this physical operation can be implemented by arithmetic on $X_1$ alone and does not read the hidden loop index.

In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool.

In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives California residents a right to opt out of the selling and sharing of their personal information. In two experiments we evaluate to which extent popular apps on the Android platform enable California residents to exercise their CCPA opt-out right. In our first experiment -- manually exercising the opt-out right via app-level UIs for a set of 100 apps -- we find that only 48 apps implement the legally mandated setting, which suggests that CCPA opt-out right non-compliance is a broader issue on the platform. In our second experiment -- automatically exercising the opt-out right at the platform-level by sending Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals -- we find for an app dataset of $1,811$ apps that GPC is largely ineffective. While we estimate with 95% confidence that 62%--81% of apps in our app dataset must respect the CCPA's opt-out right, many apps do not do so. Disabling apps' access to the AdID, which is not intended for exercising the CCPA opt-out right but could have practical effect in this regard, does not lead to a different result. For example, when sending GPC signals and disabling apps' access to the AdID, 338 apps still had the ccpa status of the ad network Vungle set to opted in while only 26 had set it to opted out. Overall, our results suggest a compliance gap as California residents have no effective way of exercising their CCPA opt-out right on the Android platform; neither at the app- nor at the platform-level.

Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline.", "published": "2025-12-03T13:41:02Z", "updated": "2025-12-03T13:41:02Z", "authors": ["Minghui Xu", "Yihao Guo", "Yanqiang Zhang", "Zhiguang Shan", "Guangyong Shang", "Zhen Ma", "Bin Xiao", "Xiuzhen Cheng"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03791v1"}

MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses.

We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones.

A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions.

We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them.

Such approaches overlook cognitive and perceptual factors that influence an attacker's initial decision to engage or withdraw. This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios.

However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality.

Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency.

The key idea is an in-memory single-FeFET XOR scheme, where the ciphertext is encoded in the device threshold voltage and leverages the direction-dependent current flow of the FeFET for single-cycle decryption; eliminating complementary bit storage also removes the need for two write cycles, allowing faster encryption. We extend the approach to multi-level-cell (MLC) FeFETs to store multiple bits per transistor. We validate the proposed idea through both simulation and experimental evaluations.

In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures.

The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes.
